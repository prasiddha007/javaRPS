# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Java. The user plays against the computer, and the game continues in a loop until the user decides to quit.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prasiddha007/javaRPS.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

cd javaRPS
```

### Running the Game

Compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. The computer will randomly choose Rock (`r`), Paper (`p`), or Scissors (`s`).
3. You will be prompted to make your choice by entering `R`, `P`, or `S`:
   - `R` for Rock
   - `P` for Paper
   - `S` for Scissors
4. The program will compare your choice with the computer's choice and display the result:
   - "Game is a tie!" if both choices are the same.
   - "You win!" if your choice beats the computer's choice.
   - "You lose." if the computer's choice beats yours.
5. You will be asked if you want to play again. Enter `y` to play again, or any other key to exit the game.
